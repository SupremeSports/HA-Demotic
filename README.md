# HA-Demotic

See here my home automation... More details to come, but simply put, I purchase no overpriced IoT devices, I build everything with my own codes using ESPs and arduinos. Two basic protocols are to be used: MQTT and Modbus (being deprecated slowly). As off now, I got everything I want at much lower prices.

There's two categories:

 - Devices:
   - Inlcudes the Arduino IDE code
   - Includes basic config for Home Assistant
   
 - Home Assistant:
   - Includes all configurations to help you reproduce what I did
